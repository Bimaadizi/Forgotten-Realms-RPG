        <p>This is a collection of System Prompts for my Janitor.AI bot 'Forgotten Realms RPG'. With full prompts designed to help steer and correct mistakes made by Janitor AI and various LLMs 
		<br><br>This page also includes each section of segments you can splice and use based on your needs and experience. 
		<br><br>note that System Prompts use tokens, and more tokens = running out of memory faster. Below are some dropdown boxes you can use, if unsure, use [DEFAULT]
		<br><br> If you use Janitor AI, using prompts that add functionality may not work properly, (ex. Feature+, Grognard, Deepseek), but you can try and get varying success with some simpler modules. If you paying for a proxy using API credits, higher tokens mean higher costs for you. 
        <br><br> Using the copy button will save a small amount of tokens, rather than manually copying the prompt.

				Included Modules: Inventory, Better Shops, Party, Reputation, D20.
				<br> This system prompt is generally compatible with Janitor AI, but will require some handholding and utilize high tokens. D20 is unlikely to work (Can be removed to save tokens), your bots first message is very important for Inventory, Party, and Reputation to work. Some handholding may be required.

<p> Above is a visual guide on how to add system prompts on Janitor, ALWAYS remember to set your generation setting to 0 after changing your system prompt, and presumably remove it after using the bot -- Unless you want DnD mechanics when talking to dante stone.
        <section id="Modules">
        <img class="title-image" src="MODULES.png" alt="Guide">

<p> Below, you will find 'Modules', these can be added to your System Prompt to enhance your experience. These add in gameplay experiences, like Inventory, better shops, D20 mechanics, etc. If you are using Janitor AI, some modules will be too complicated for Janitor. Using too many modules will degrade priorities for other modules, and make them less effective, too many will also degrade memory quickly as they take up a lot of tokens.
<br><br> If you are using Janitor AI, I would recommend using 'Inventory' and 'Better Shops'. Some modules will require more handholding, you can get some UI modules (Reputation, Journal, Health, and Fatigue) to function by editing the bot's messages until it adapts it (Note: Too many UI modules may lead to messages being cut off, this can be helped by setting Max New Tokens to 0, but can still occur), but it's function will be finnicky.
<br><br> Be mindful of the amount of tokens being used by your system prompt to avoid memory loss. If you are using a proxy you will experience better results from the modules as well as better memory. Combat and D20 is not advised for Janitor AI users.
<br><br> Janitor AI has good and bad days, sometimes it works good, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes Janitor makes an update that hurts various aspects of the bot. Your mileage with these prompts may vary. Sometimes resetting the System Prompts can fix it, just open the Advance Prompts box, change a single character, and save. (Remember to set max new tokens to 0 afterwards.)

<p> If you are having any issues with certain prompts, sometimes adding in "[PERMANENT SYSTEM PROMPT: XYZ]" will help, with XYZ being stern instructions, voiced absolutely (i.e use words Always, Will, Never) to correct parts of the bot (ex.

<p> I don't have time to make it right now, but segments will be sections of text you can copy into the system prompt, it is not the same as modules which add functionality, instead it will be things like details on the format of messages, reinforcing ideas, etc. It acts as an extension of the base system prompt rather than as modules.</p>

<h2> How to use Deepseek R1 for free.</h2>
<h5> Notice: Deepseek R1 is free on Openrouter, but mostly as a marketing tactic for Openrouter. Openrouter may remove Deepseek R1(Free), and this may become outdated.</h5>

<p> Go to <a href="https://openrouter.ai/">openrouter.ai</a> and create an account.
<br><br> Next, go to the API key page available here: <a href="https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys"> openrouter.ai/settings/keys</a>
<br><br> Give the key a name, the credit limit is irrelevant for this purpose. After you have an API key, Save it somewhere, you will not see it again (But if you lose it you can make a new key.)
<br><br> Go to Janitor AI, enter the proxy settings (Typically displayed as 'Using Janitor' or 'Using Proxy' in the right corner of the page when using a bot.)
<br><br> Select 'Proxy' instead of 'JanitorLLM Beta'.
<br><br> fill out the page exactly as written here:
<br><br> Model: Select 'Custom' and type 'deepseek/deepseek-r1:free' in the box below it. NOTE: It must be in all lowercase.
<br><br> Other API/Proxy URL: enter 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions' into the field DO NOT CLICK THE LINK and then copy it. Copy it exactly as written here!!.
<br><br> API Key: Enter your API key from openrouter here.
<br><br> Custom Prompt: Your desired system prompt and modules from this page.
<br><br> Test your key by pressing "Check API Key/Model"
<br><br> Recommended: Set Max Token Generation to 0 in Janitor AI's generation settings (This will be reset each time you update your proxy info, including system prompt updates.)
<br><br><br> If you encounter any errors, ensure everything is entered correctly, you may have entered it in wrong, accidentally left a character in, a space at the end. If you don't get a response, it could be that Openrouter is limiting you, keep trying to generate a message.
</p>

<h2> How to use other proxies for free.</h2>
<h5> Notice: Deepseek R1 is free on Openrouter, but mostly as a marketing tactic for Openrouter. Openrouter may remove Deepseek R1(Free), and this may become outdated.</h5>

<p> Follow the above steps to achieve this. The only difference is that in the Model: section, replace 'deepseek/deepseek-r1:free' with another free model from Openrouter.
<br><br> Here are a list of examples:
<br><br> Gemini Pro 2.0: google/gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05:free
<br><br> Claude Sonnet: anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:beta
<br><br> Meta: Llama: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free
<br><br><br> You can find more by putting "Free" in the Openrouter's search tab to try other models they offer for free, I have not tested these models and can not verify how they function.
</p>
<h2> How to use Deepseek R1. (Paid)</h2>
<p> Deepseek R1 is a good model, I'm not sure if Deepseek R1 is better paid, I've noticed I haven't seen Deepseek include it's thinking process which is something other people have had issues with, nor does it ever have any issues generating messages (which openrouter does). Using Deepseek R1 directly is more reliable.
<br><br> Create an account on <a href="https://platform.deepseek.com/sign_in"> platform.deepseek.com</a> 
<br><br> Add money to your balance ($5 goes a long way, and I believe it is the minimum amount.)
<br><br> Select API keys from the sidebar on the left, and create an API key. Give it a name and copy your API key and save it somewhere, you will not see it again. (But if you lose it you can make a new key.)
<br><br> Go to Janitor AI, enter the proxy settings (Typically displayed as 'Using Janitor' or 'Using Proxy' in the right corner of the page when using a bot.)
<br><br> Select 'Proxy' instead of 'JanitorLLM Beta'. 
<br><br> Fill out  the page exactly as written here:
<br><br> Model: Select Custom and type: 'deepseek-reasoner' (all lowercase)
<br><br> Other API/Proxy URL: enter 'https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions?model='deepseek-reasonor'/chat/completions' into the field DO NOT CLICK THE LINK and then copy it. Copy it exactly as written here!!.
<br><br> API Key: Enter your API key from deepseek here.
<br><br> Test your key by pressing "Check API Key/Model"
<br><br> Recommended: Set Max Token Generation to 0 in Janitor AI's generation settings (This will be reset each time you update your proxy info, including system prompt updates.)
<br><br><br> If you encounter any errors, ensure everything is entered correctly, you may have entered it in wrong, accidentally left a character in, a space at the end.

</h4>
<p> I recommend visiting their gitbook, as it has resources/assets that can help improve the performance of the bot, the markdown format they use works with mine (Since that's where I got it from). They have a module's page that is currently work in progress, extra modules available there.
