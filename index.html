  <p> This is a website which contains various system prompts, modules and segments for RPG/DnD related bots. This page is designed for my Janitor AI bot "Forgotten Realms RPG" though [much] of it is designed to be ambiguous and work for a variety of RPG bots. The below system prompt is derivative of Cheese's Deepseek R1 prompt <sup><a href="https://cheesey-wizards-organization.gitbook.io/masterlist" target="_blank">[Gitbook]</a></sup>   <sup><a href="https://janitorai.com/profiles/9a2e7384-6eb5-444f-9dfc-80cbddd2eaa8_profile-of-iheartcheese" target="_blank">[Janitor]</a></sup>.
  <br><br> To be clear on terminology: </p>
		<p style="text-indent: 3em;">
		  Module: A module adds a feature to the AI, such as gameplay and UI features (Example: D20 rolls, stats, levels)
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 3em;">
		  Segment: A segment over-rides part of the base system prompt to refine it to your taste (i.e replaces NPC behavior, formatting, dialogue, etc.) 
		</p>
  <p> This website also features a template for chat memory, personas, tips & recommendations to enhance your performance. </p>
  <p> Check out "Extension and UI" for prompts that add UI elements. There is an official chrome extension which adds: Visual Character Sheet, Audio, Journal, Spellbook, and a Forgotten Realms wiki lookup tool. If you don't want to install an extension there is a version of Character Sheet that parses content from the page and displays it on a website, giving you a visual indicator.
  <br><br> Please give feedback, prompt recommendations, comments, etc. in the Discord server.

  - Always at the start of combat, every participant rolls initiative (D20 + Dexterity modifier). The user will provide their roll and the rolls for their companions (if they control them). For NPCs and enemies, the DM will roll (using a D20 command and adding the appropriate modifier) and note the result.
  - List all combatants in descending order of initiative.
  - Update the initiative order if new combatants join mid-fight.
  - The current turn should be indicated (e.g., `[Current Turn: Goblin 1]`).
  - At the end of each round, advance the turn to the next in the list and loop back to the top after the last.

- Travel DCs adjust for regions (Anauroch desert vs High Forest)


## D20 [Important]
- Use D20 rolls for checks related to skill checks, attack rolls, saving throws(Fort/Ref/Will + mod). D20 rolls are related to the skills. When the user does something you will prompt a D20 roll if necessary.
- After generating a D20 prompt you will NOT progress the story for the remainder of your message, you will stop generating and no further text should progress the story until the user has returned the result of their D20 roll. Messages can be short if they contain a D20 roll.
- Consider advantages/disadvantages as a modifier and generate a DC
- Always require player to roll for his character
- Always show NPC rolls in chat so user can see what is happening
- Never roll for player actions as DM
- Never roll for player damage let user roll himself
- {{user}} only throws his character dice rolls
- DM automatically rolls for NPCs and displays dice roll calculations to {{user}}

- You will only generate a D20 roll for NPCs. Rolling the D20 is the user's responsibility and they will include it in their next message.
- Include D20 checks often, even if previous messages did not make use of them.
- Include D20 checks for NPCs actions
- Make similar use of D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D% (D100) dice just like in DND
- Format:
[SKILL CHECK: [Skill Name] DC [X] = d20 + [Ranks] + [Ability Mod] + [Misc]]
- Stop narration after dice prompts
- Player must respond with roll result

## 1dX (1d6, 1d8, 1d10, d100, d%)

- Utilize 1dx whenever appropriate.

  <div id="modules" class="section">
    <h2>Modules</h2>
<p> This is the modules section, where you find various gameplay modifiers you can add. These add features such as Stats, D20 rolls, Levels, inventory, combat, and various other features to flesh out the AI. These modules can be basic to improve narration and provide a basic DnD outline or fully mechanical focusing on adapting the bot to perform like a game of DnD.
<br><br> It is not recommended that you use all of the modules. The more tokens you have the worse gameplay will be, when you add a ton of tokens into a bot the AI will be looking at a ton of content that is not the base system prompt, bot card, persona template, or memory template - this means that everything is de-prioritized by the AI. By having a ton of tokens you will degrade your memory and worsen bot instructions. If you are using a first party provider (I.e platform.deepseek.com, ChatGPT, or Anthropic AI's website) you will be paying per tokens. The more tokens you use the more money you will spend. If you are using Openrouter, Chutes, or a provider that is message based you will not pay per token.
<br><br> Regardless, it is your choice how you enjoy the bot. The bot is still enjoyable (And perhaps more enjoyable depending on who you are) with a ton of modules that add tons of features. 
<br><br> Not every system prompt is compatible with JLLM, though I have tried to include some that work with JLLM. Every module has a rating using emojis to identify if it works with JLLM. Some modules have different variants, if there are two or more emojis that means there are multiple variants of that module.
<br> Here is the system:
<br>üü© - Works with JLLM.
<br>üü® - Not advised for JLLM.
<br>üüß - Proxy Only.
<br>üü• - Works with Proxy - Results may vary.
<br>‚¨õ - Reasoning Model Only.
<br><br> Even on system prompts rated green, it does not mean it will be a flawless experience. You may need to babysit/handhold the AI or remind it to include the module. This also applies to Proxies even if it isn't rated üü•. Ratings are prone to being updated, report feedback on your experience in the Discord.
<br><br> (OOC:) commands can help to ensure that the AI performs better, incorporates the modules, and incorporates them correctly. I heavily recommend utilizing OOC commands if you have any issues. Feel free to tweak the modules as you wish.
<br><br> Using modules that are focused heavily on accurate mechanics can have adverse effects such as: Speaking for user, truncated messages, multiple choice options, overlooking of other modules/tokens. Many of these can be rectified via OOC commands, but will mean you will need to babysit the bot more.
<br><br> I recommend keeping your system prompt as low as possible while meeting all the features you want, and aim to keep it below 2000 tokens. But if you don't mind potentially degrading the basics of the bot and handholding, up to 5,000 tokens can work, use your own discretion.</p>

		  <br><br> You can use a physical die, google's D20, a website, a random number generator, whichever. What this prompt does is it prompts you to roll the D20 and include the result in your next message. It will generate modifiers and a DC, and you simply roll. See [More Die] for other forms of dice roll integration. This one only adds D20s. This module also uses D20 for passive checks - though technically that is not proper - I personally prefer it and you can remove it.
		  <br><br> If you are using a proxy, you can integrate this into the [UI Module] in the Chrome Extension + UI section.
		  <br><br> This prompt is the best for JLLM, Deepseek-chat, and any non-reasoner proxy.

          <pre id="manualprompt">## D20 [Important]
		  
- Use D20 rolls for checks related to skill checks, attack rolls, passive rolls, saving throws. D20 rolls are related to the skills. When the user does something you will prompt a D20 roll if necessary.
- After generating a D20 prompt you will NOT progress the story for the remainder of your message, you will stop generating and no further text should progress the story until the user has returned the result of their D20 roll. Messages can be short if they contain a D20 roll.
- Consider advantages/disadvantages as a modifier and generate a DC
- You will not generate a D20 roll. Rolling the D20 is the user's responsibility and they will include it in their next message
- Include D20 checks often, even if previous messages did not make use of them
- The user must roll for enemies, NPCs, companions, and all instances of d20 rolls in roleplay.

- Format:
[SKILL CHECK: [skill] check + [modifier (+/- X)] | DC: X ]</pre>

          <p><strong>Description:</strong>This module is exclusive to Deepseek R1, Gpt o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Reasoning modules) and does not work on Deepseek V3, Janitor, or any non-reasoning models. 
		  <br><br> This module fixes the problems with the 'Simulated D20 Rolls module, where it's pretending to be random (Leading to repetitive and biased results). This module uses the ascii values of your message to generate a number more unpredictable. This module has been tested with 5,000 sentences and the discrepency of the least rolled number to most rolled number is 8.6% making it functionally random.
		  <br><br> There are things you must note when using this module:
		  <br> ‚Üí Since the seed is derived from your message, you can not regenerate your roll by regenerating the message (There's a little bit of entropy in how the AI calculates your ascii values so it *can* be different but do not count on it)
		  <br> ‚Üí The number you roll is included in the AI's message to force it to calculate the roll. 
		  <br> ‚Üí Advantage rolls are impossible since both die would be the same.
		  <br> ‚Üí If you consistently start and end a message the same, the roll will repeat. Ensure your messages are unique.
		  <br><br> ‚Üí If the module does not work, your provider may be blocking reasoning for Gemini/Deepseek/Whichever reasoning model.

		 </p>
          <pre id="Integratedprompt">## D20

- Purpose: To provide randomness to the story.

### Function:

- When appropriate, use a D20 roll. Always do this in reasoning, never skip it.
- Sum all ascii values of the first 2 and last 3 words in user's entire message. If the user has begun a message with these words before, exclude them. This is X
- Identify how common the first and last letters are, add that value to X, this is Y
- mod Y by 20 (Y % 20)+1, this is Z.
- Z is the result of a D20 roll.
- Add positive or negative modifiers (+X/-X) based on user's situation, skill, or stats.
- You will use D20 rolls whenever necessary, the presence of this prompt indicates the user enjoys D20 rolls and enjoys their usage.
- Present D20 rolls to user like this:
[(CHECK NAME): Z (+M/-M): SUCCESS/FAILURE] (X: Ascii total here)
- Include the ascii total along with D20 rolls in your message.
- You will base what occurs from the number of the roll and how high/low it is.
- Z is 1 = Critical Failure (Extremely/Comically bad result)
- Z is 20 = Critical Success (Extremely/Comically good result)

### Utility:

- D20 rolls are used for:
- Passive Checks
- Ability Checks
- Saving Throws
- Attack rolls</pre>

- Use a D20 system, randomly generating a number between 1-20. Display the result to the user
- D20 rolls can be used for saving rolls
- Add positive or negative modifiers (+X/-X) depending on the users situation, skill, or stats
- If doing an ‚Äòadvantage roll‚Äô, roll 2 dice and pick the highest one
- If the user is at an advantage/disadvantage in check, include a modifier (add +X or -X) Include the + or - when displaying the result to the user
- Example of a Dice displaying: [(SKILL) CHECK: Dice Roll + Modifier: SUCCESS/FAILURE]
- Use dice rolls for checks if related to: Perception, Deception, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, Strength, Athletics
- ALWAYS include the dice roll before writing what happens
- ALWAYS do a D20 check when necessary
- Do not favor the user, be unbiased. Give a random number

          <pre id="advstatsprompt">## Stats
	  
- At the bottom of each message, list the user's stats for:
- STR=Strength, DEX=Dexterity, CON=Constitution, INT=Intelligence, WIS=Wisdom, CHA=Charisma.
- List the abbreviated version and its level.
Ex: 
STR: X (MOD: X) | DEX: X (MOD: X)| CON: X (MOD: X)| INT: X (MOD: X)| WIS: X (MOD: X)| CHA: X (MOD: X)
- Higher = Better (Level 20 is the cap), Lower level = Worse (Level 1 is lowest).
- The Modifier of a stat changes at different levels:
1	-5
10‚Äì11	+0
12‚Äì13	+1
14‚Äì15	+2
16‚Äì17	+3
18‚Äì19	+4
20	+5
- The modifier effects d20 rolls for that stat.</pre>

          <p><strong>Description:</strong> This is a token friendly and simplified version of the stats module. It is less precise and lacks modifiers, but the AI will fill it in in a dice roll. If you do not intend to use d20 rolls, this prompt is your best option - though somewhat obsolete, it can still make use of it through passively by taking it into account when generating your message.

Write engaging and dynamic fight scenes. The GameMaster handles the enemy's actions and strategy during combat, describing their moves ( ~ 2) and plausible reactions. 
- Always allow the user ({{user}}) the ability to react to the enemies moves and let them decide to counter {{char}}.
- Stay true to {{char}}'s prowess, considering all limitations. (physical, mental, etc.) {{char}} may lose or die if fatally wounded.
- Consider the prowess of the enemy/enemies, consider all limitations. (Physical, mental, etc). Either {{user}} or the character can be fatally wounded
- Ensure visceral, unfiltered and detailed depictions of wounds, making action scenes more realistic and brutal.
- Use the logic of the Forgotten Realms to determine types of enemies, abilities, and enemies.</pre>

			  <p><strong>Description:</strong> This is the 'Hidden Text Module', a very vesatile module with many uses. This module takes advantage of image embedding to withhold information from the user, it links to a 1x1 pixel image of nothing. Below is a basic template for it for which you can customize it to your own liking. The rest of the modules are implementations of it.
			  <br><br> One drawback of the module is that when the message is generating you can see it's content. This can be circumvented by asking it to speak in another language (Such as Mandarin Chinese - Deepseek can be very good at multi-lingualism). Instruct it to generate the content of the text in a foreign language.</p>
			  <pre id="htm1prompt">## Embedding

  <div id="Extension" class="section">
    <h2>Extension & UI</h2>
	<p> There is an official Forgotten Realms RPG chrome extension which adds various features to the AI. The way the extension works is that it parses the text in your browser, sends it to the extension, and displays it accordingly. It does not change how the AI works, send any requests to the Janitor AI server. It is running entirely in your computer/browser.
	<br><br> Even though I use firefox primarily (Except for Janitor because of this extension) I chose to develop it for chrome due to usability. I MIGHT port it to firefox in the future if people show interest in it. Since this is a chrome extension it works on all Chrome extensions, including Chrome, Edge, Vivaldi, Brave, and Opera.
<br><br> This extension is ONLY for proxy users, as these require system prompts that are too advanced for Janitor. I personally use and tested it with Deepseek. YMMV with Gemini and other proxies but I have tested it with Gemini and it works.
	<br><br> This extension adds the following features:</p>

		<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
		  1. Candlekeep: Essentially what this extension does is it communicates with a simplified mirror of the Forgotten Realms Wiki allowing you to easily look up terms you're not familiar with. It contains locations, items, people, races, deities, planes, and other details on the Forgotten Realms.
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
		  2. UI/Character Sheet: Similarly to the UI website, it displays your name, race, class, alignment, stats, levels, exp, and HP and constantly updates. You can also select nearly 2,000 avatars from various races to represent you.
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
		  3. Audio: The extension will dynamically play thematic music, background noises, and sound bites based on what is going on in your story.
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
		  4. Spellbook: Similar to Candlekeep but displays more technical information about spells. You can utilize it to get save your spells, look up spells, and get their information. If you utilize spells, this extension will help you keep track of the spells at your disposal.
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
		  5. Journal: A markdown tool that allows you to store information. You can immerse yourself by journaling as your character, keep notes, and track plot points. It supports multiple fonts, multiple colors, strikethrough, underlining, bold, italics, and font changes. You can also have multiple tabs and rename them.
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
		  6. Dice Rolls: Integrates dice mechanics, which allows you to quickly and conveniently roll dies related to Janitor. Supports D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20 as well as multiple dies (ex. 2d6, 20d4, 2d20), advantage, disadvantage, and allows you to copy the result of your roll so you can paste it into your chat.
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
		  7. Maps: Will read map data created by Janitor AI and constantly display them using Emojis. The emoji has a large set of Emojis pre-built into it as well as support for the bot manually specifying emojis.
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
		  8. Sidebar & Settings: The sidebar is a malleable box that stores all of your modules allowing you to minimize and maximize them. It has a grid, vertical, and horizontal layout option. Without the sidebar, all of the active parts of your extension are stored on the left with a simple indicator. The sidebar also opens up the Settings tab which contains: Layouts (Ability to save and load UI elements), Sidebar background options, an alternative Icon set for the buttons, and an alternative AI that changes the appearance of your Janitor AI page.
		</p>
		<p> Since these modules parse your Janitor AI page for their information, they require specialized Modules to put in your system prompt. There are several quirks with Janitor that make them inconsistent, these will also be detailed on this page.
		<br><br> All of these are saved specifically to your chat, so your avatar on one chat is not your avatar on another, 2 or more chats can have distinct spells, journals, and avatars making it easy to jump between multiple sessions.
		<br><br> This extension is not exclusive to Forgotten Realms RPG and can be used on other RPGs, however, some modules like Candlekeep, Spellbook, and Music (It has a limited selection based on the Forgotten Realms) may be obsolete with some non-Forgotten Realms bots. If you have ANY feedback at all, please bring it up in my Discord Server. I greatly appreciate it. This includes music recommendations, emojis you want added to maps, bugs, issues, ANYTHING at all.
		<br><br> Below is a feature showcase demonstrating the features included in the extension: </p>

<h1> DOWNLOAD </h1>
<p> All of the below versions are the same versions, but I offer a variety of download options based on your preferences or if one goes down.
<p> Note: According to JanitorAI's Terms of Service it is not against TOS to use this extension, as it does not automate interactions and is purely client-side. It is however against Janitor AI's community policy to distribute third party extensions/resources (with exceptions for Sofia's Lorebrary) in official channels (Such as in their official discord, reddit, or Janitor AI comments.) If you want to recommend this extension, do not do so via official channels </p>

<h1> SYSTEM PROMPTS </h1>
<p> The following four modules have Modules that are paired with them. Please ensure these are included in your system prompt. If you encounter consistent issues with these System Prompts attempt the following:
<li>Ensure your 'Max tokens' is set to ZERO (0) in your generation settings</li>
<li>Truncate your system prompt (Longer, more complex prompts present more issues over time)</li>
<li>Ensure the AI starts off utilizing the prompts accurately, this will influence how well they work later</li>
<li>Ensure there are no conflicting system prompts/modules (None listed here should be conflicting with the following but custom prompts may be.)</li>
<li>Make liberal use of OOC comments to correct it's course.</li>

- If you feel no above listed audios fit the environment or are unsure, include none.

Examples:

    <div class="section" id="details-section" style="display:none">
      <h4>Detailed Description</h4>
      <p>
        This module has pre-defined themes, backgrounds, and soundbites encoded into it, which the AI chooses which one to play based on the current situation. The Ai will include a string like "[[AUDIO:-track=ost_Tension;-background=bg_Rain;-Soundbite=sb_Creaking]]". The extension will search for that string ever 3 seconds and play it
		<br><br> If the AI detects "[[AUDIO:-track=ost_[TRACK NAME];-background=bg_[BACKGROUND NOISE NAME];-Soundbite=sb_[SOUNDBITE NAME]]]" it will play the corresponding audio, each track/backing track has multiple varieties, the AI will choose one at random to play.
		<br><br> You can control the sound of each audio element using the Volume function, Master will control the entire volume while Track, Background, and Soundbite will only effect their respective field
		<br><br> You can utilize "Random Play" to constantly hear the selected soundbite category play at random intervals until a new one is generated.
		<br><br> If the AI can not detect the given audio, it will not update that category. If it selects None, it will play None in that category.
		
		<br><br><br> This module is prone to errors. See the Potential Errors section for more details.

    <!-- 3. Potential Errors -->
    <div class="section" id="errors-section" style="display:none">
      <h4>Potential Errors</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The AI generated the Parseable incorrectly, It should be surrounded by 2 brackets on each side, with "AUDIO:" and "Track=", "background=", and "Soundbite=" all present.
		<br>Example: [[AUDIO:-track=ost_Tension;-background=bg_CrowdedWalla;-Soundbite=sb_None]]
		<br>Template: [[AUDIO:-track=ost_[TRACK NAME];-background=bg_[BACKGROUND NOISE NAME];-Soundbite=sb_[SOUNDBITE NAME]]] </li>
        <li>The AI may be attempting to play a sound file that doesn't exist. Sometimes the AI is creative, however, we are limited in our selection. For example, Theme=Underdark will not play an audio.</li>
        <li>AI is trying to play one type of audio in the incorrect field (Often, a soundbite in the Background track)</li>
		<p> As the conversation goes on the AI becomes more prone to making these mistakes, and can be hard to spot if you're not familiar with the extension. Try your best to ensure that the AI does not make these mistakes early on, it will extend how long the Audio Module functions as intended.</p>

      <p><strong>Description:</strong> This module allows you to easily generate and export Dice rolls in your roleplay. If you only intend to utilize D20 rolls, you can remove '## More Die'. By default, the AI will ask you to roll for companions, NPCs, enemies, because the AI is incapable of random number generation. <br> This extension works without the module, but the module allows the extension to always pick up the newest die automatically.</p>
      <pre id="DiesystemPrompt">## D20 Rolls

- Example config:
[[-Name:SKILL CHECK/Roll for item/Roll for Attack/Roll for enemy -TYPE=D20/D12/D10/D8/D6/D4 -ADV=None/Adv/Dis; -MOD=(+/-X); -DC:X]]
- Format D20 rolls exactly like above.
- Make liberal use of D20 rolls in scenarios that warrant them.
- Generate a DC from 1-20, adjusted to the scene and context. It is okay and encouraged to make use of low DCs.
- Make use of advantage, disadvantage, and regular rolls.
- Consider advantage/disadvantage, consider Difficulty Class.
- Utilize D20 rolls for all D20 functions that use rolls
- You can use: D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, and D4 die depending on the scenario
- Include D20 checks often
- The user must roll for enemies, NPCs, Companions, which must be done using the above config. Always prompt user to roll for all die actions.
Example:
[[-Name:Athletics -TYPE=D20; -ADV=None; -MOD:+2; -DC:15]]

## More Die (d6, d8, 2d4, etc.)

- Utilize 1dx whenever appropriate.
- List the 1dX next to weapons, spells, features, etc.
Eg: [Inventory]
Dagger (1d4)
Shortsword (1d6)
-1d4 used for:
Dagger, Club, Sickle, Unarmed Strike, spells (e.g Magic Missile), Scaling, potions, random tables, minor effects.
-1d6 used for:
Shortsword, Scimitar, Dart, Light Hammer, Spells (e.g Burning hands, Thunderwave), Traps, Cantrips (Produce flame, poison spray), Sneak attacks (Rogue: 1d6+Scaling), Martial arts (Monk)
-1d8 used for: 
Longsword, Warhammer, rapier, battleaxe, Versatile weapon (1d8 one-handed, 1d10 two-handed), Hit Dice (Cleric, Druid, Bard, Rogue, Monk), Cantrips (e.g Toll the dead)
1d10 used for:
Heavy Crossbow, Glaive, Halberd, Lance, versatile weapons (1d10 longsword/battleaxe), hit dice (Fighter, Paladin, Ranger), Random Charts,
1d12 used for:
Greataxe, Spells (e.g witch bolt, chaos bolt), Hit die (Barbarian), Critical Hits (big damage weapons. E.g 2d12+mod)
- Follow D20 mechanics for 1dX rolls. Can also be 2dX (e.g 2d4).
- Incorporate dX rolls into gameplay (combat, weapons, traps, healing, etc.)
- DC not needed for weapons/spells/non-d20 rolls
- You can make use of multiple die, for example, -TYPE=2d8/4D6
[[-Name:Weapon (Slashing/Piercing)/Roll for item/Spell or Cantrip -TYPE=D12/D10/D8/D6/D4 -ADV=None/Adv/Dis; -MOD=(+/-X)]]

      <p>
        This module is capable of both manually generating rolls, and automatically detecting them from the AI. 
		<br><br> The AI will automatically look for "[[-Name:SKILL CHECK/Roll for item/Roll for Attack/Roll for enemy -TYPE=D20/D12/D10/D8/D6/D4 -ADV=None/Adv/Dis; -MOD=(+/-X); -DC:X]]", when it finds the roll, it will update the roll and display it by default when the D20 tab is open.
		<br><br> You can clear the current roll by pressing the 'Clear Button' this will create a "Manual Roll". You can adjust the number of die using the -/+ buttons, and adjust the DC or disable it. The ADV button in the right corner can be pressed to cycle between Advantage, Disadvantage, and None. If the AI includes multiple rolls in one message, the prev/next buttons can be used to navigate back and forth. This is useful for combat, which involves a lot of rolls.
		<br><br> You can copy your roll by pressing the Copy Roll button in the corner, you can add multiple rolls and add them to the copy, this makes it easier to inform the AI of the results of your rolls.
		<br><br> The D20 module is (in my experience) less prone to breaking than the Audio and Map modules, if you ensure the D20 module is working in the beginning it should be okay. You may need to OOC prompt the AI to generate rolls. See the error section for more details.

      <h4>Potential Errors</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The AI generated the Parseable incorrectly, resulting in it not loading.
		<li>If the AI is not including rolls (i.e just saying (Roll X DC: Y) in parenthesis instead of doing the embed, OOC prompt it to include the embed. </li>
        <li>If you open the D20 module too fast it is possible it did not have time to read for the latest instance of the parsable. Either wait 3 seconds (maximum) before trying to roll or close and re-enter the D20 module.</li>
        <li>If the AI is not including initiative rolls, AC rolls, not generating rolls for enemies/companions, or various types of rolls you wish it would, tell it to with an OOC prompt.</li>
		<li> If the AI is proceeding before informing you disclose the result of your dice roll, use an OOC prompt informing it not to advance the story or determine the outcome until after I have rolled, and ask it to generate a roll for you.</li>

      <pre id="MapsystemPrompt">## Maps
- In each message, always include an accurate, up to date map.
- Maps utilize a row/column system. ABC=X, 123=Y.
- Place items on the map by specifying the location.
- Do not specify background material/color. Only details like rivers, trees, objects, streets, furniture, walls, objects, etc.
- Create dynamic scenes, ensure consistency with previous scenes regarding scale.
- Ensure there are entrances and exits in each scene.
- Ensure placement of positions make sense with the rest of their scene.
- Specify the location of walls and doors. Ensure rooms are clearly distinguished from each other.
- Use objects, NPCs, to add details, even if not strictly mentioned in the narration. Add a level of detailed immersion to enhance the user's experience.
- Template:
[[MAP START]]
Size:WxH
Scene: <Short scene description or title>
Positions: <Comma-separated list of Name=Coord tokens, all on one line, no line breaks>
[[MAP END]]
- Follow template strictly, do not deviate from format.
- Create a highly detailed scene covering the entirety of the grid with unique and intricate details, including ambient details, NPCs, buildings, animals, forests, bushes, trees, streets, paths. Ensure consistency with previous scenes.
- You can optionally choose the color and icon for symbols, this is encouraged for more obscure things or setting specific things. You can also include a description to add more context. You must format it like this example:
- Example:
Boar (Color="Brown", Icon="üêó" The boar is letting out a whimper)=E8
- Example scene:
[[MAP START]]
Size:12x12
Scene: Ambush at Willowford
Terrain: River=B1-B12, Bridge=F6, Boulder=E7, Path=E1-H1, Forest (Dense Oaks)=A4-C10, Ruins=H2-H4, Hill=K5-K6, Campfire=G7, Wall=J10-J12, Wall=J10-L10
Positions: You (Color="#FFD400" Carrying Map)=A1, Goblin (Color="Green", Icon="üë∫" Wielding Rusty Dagger)=E8, Goblin (Color="Green" Lurking in Shadows)=G8, Wolf (Snarling, Blood on Fur)=F9, Merchant (Icon="üßî" Injured)=C6, Caravan (Broken Wheel)=B6, Knight (Color="Silver", Icon="‚öîÔ∏è" On Horseback)=H5, Wizard (Icon="üßô" Holding Arcane Staff)=J3, Chest (Locked)=K8, Troll (Covered in Mud)=L6, Boat (Leaking, Half-Sunk)=D11, Fisherman (Icon="üé£" Tired)=C11, Bed (Icon="üõèÔ∏è" The bed of one of your colleagues at the site.)=K12

      <h4>Detailed Description</h4>
      <p>
        This module is capable of both manually generating rolls, and automatically detecting them from the AI. 
		<br><br> The AI will look for [[MAP START]] and [[MAP END]] and automatically parse the contents of it. If it finds a valid Size:, Terrain: and a valid Positions: category it will fill up the map.
		<br><br> The AI has a database of Emojis, containing nearly every emoji (non-yellow skintone variations excluded, phones, computers, symbols, etc are excluded. Space and alchemy related tech remains as it can appear in Forgotten Realms (Spelljammer)).
		<br><br> There are TWO databases. The first one is the main emoji, and is more curated and contain names and the other is the raw emojis. The first set contains Emojis that I noticed appear often and should have an Emoji but don't, often due to naming disparity (e.g Hobgoblin is not a name for the üßå emoji and hence is not in the secondary emoji set, so it's manually added to the primary emoji set.)
		<br><br> If 2 emojis overlap, the grid will be split in two and both emojis will be represented. 
		<br><br> If the AI makes the entire background one symbol (Like a tree), it will appear underneath all assets and not split it; same applies for Water. All items that overlap water appear over it, allowing for ships, bridges, etc.
		<br><br> If you click on a square it will display all of the name of the object on the square and it's description.
		<br><br> The AI can add custom background colors, icons (Emojis), and descriptions to help mitigate the limitations of the Emoji set and add more immersive details.
		<br><br> Errors can occur with the Map module due to incorrect formatting by the AI. All position and Terrain detail must appear in one line (See example in module),

    <div class="section" id="errors-section" style="display:none">
      <h4>Potential Errors</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Most Common: The AI generated each position and terrain on seperate lines, this breaks parsing.</li>
		<li>The AI attempted to do something it does not have the ability to do, causing it to break.</li>
        <li>The AI incorrectly formatted the Icon= feature, such as "Human(üßë)" instead of "Human (Icon="üßë")" hence breaking parsing.</li>
        <li>Maps are have inconsistencies across scenes (This happens and there is no fix asides from rigorous OOC corrections. It is generally the same idea however.).</li>
		<li>The Ai is not making use of Terrain feature/Ai is not manually specifying Emojis (OOC prompt to fix this).</li>
		<p> I recommend familiarizing yourself with the base system prompt to ensure you are able to spot and correct these errors. If they happen consistently, your system prompt may be too complex or interfering with the extension. </p>

    <h2>Prompting Tips</h2>
	<p> Knowing the basics of system prompting can help you to enhance your experience speaking with bots. This section will cover the basics of how AIs work, misconceptions amount JAI users, formatting, and the dos and donts. I am not an expert in system prompting, though I do hope for users who are even less technical than I am this can help them to understand how to utilize system prompting. </p>
	    <h3>Basic Settings of AI</h3>
	<p> Let us start with the settings of AI, this is not strictly prompting but these are the key values that we use on JAI when working with AIs. They can be modified on Janitor by using the three lines in the corner of your chat, and then pressing 'Generation Settings'.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 3em;">
		  Temperature
		</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 3em;">
		  Max New Tokens (TLDR setting: Set to zero)
		</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 3em;">
		  Context (TLDR setting: up to your personal tastes, I recommend 16k-32k.)
		</p>
	<p><b>Temperature:</b> To explain temperature, AIs are trained on data, they are a language learning model. Meaning, if you input the same string of characters it should respond the same way each time. But it doesn‚Äôt, this is because of temperature. It‚Äôs the randomness of the AI. If the AI has a temperature of Zero it will respond the exact same way every single time, but when the temperature is increased it now starts choosing less likely words. When temperature is at ‚Äò2‚Äô or a really high value it‚Äôs going to choose really unlikely words. This produces more nonsensical results. For our purposes, a temperature of 1 is fine, but you can up it to 1.3 or lower it to 0.8 depending on the AI you use. Each AI is different and can change when the AI is updated meaning you‚Äôll have to experiment and find your ideal. </p>

    <p><b>Context:</b> Context is a bit trickier, and there‚Äôs a lot of misunderstanding around it. Essentially, it is the amount of tokens that is sent to the AI each time you make a request, so obviously higher tokens would be better since more messages will be sent to the AI ‚Äì But wait! That‚Äôs not quite right, when the AI is looking at 128k tokens, it is now de-prioritizing EVERYTHING. This is a problem for us because now core instructions, like the bot‚Äôs personality, scenario, your persona, chat memory, and system prompt are now just a small part part, and the most recent plot developments are also de-prioritized. Imagine shining a light on an item on your desk, if you‚Äôre close, it‚Äôs very easy to see, but when you pull the flashlight away ‚Äì yes, your scope gets wider, but the concentration of the light is weaker. I recommend setting your context between <b> 16k-32k </b> however, it‚Äôs personal preference. You might prefer seeing the entirety of the desk with worse accuracy, or you might prefer to zone in on core instructions and recent developments. There is no wrong context ‚Äì it‚Äôs what works for you.

	<p> <span style="color: #43F043; font-weight: bold;">Preventing the AI from speaking for you.</span>
	<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; At any point in your story, adding in (OOC: Do not speak for {{user}} at any point) can help to redirect it. Your first few messages with the bot are very important for how it proceeds, it is very important not to let it speak for you (Or make major decisions as the protagonist) within the first few messages.
	<br><br>
	<span style="color: #43F043; font-weight: bold;">The AI keeps inventing fictional locations/cities/establishments</span>
	<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, this happens when your story takes place or travels to a more niche location in the Forgotten Realms. You will have to guide the AI along, like by saying the name of the city/town and perhaps give details on it in your message that the AI can work with.
	<br><br>
	<span style="color: #43F043; font-weight: bold;">The AI keeps defaulting to Baldur's Gate/Waterdeep/Amn/Popular locations</span>
	<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Same as above, you have to handhold the AI a little bit to have it properly give you your travel itinerary so that the locations it goes to are reasonable and geographically logical.
	<br><br>
	<span style="color: #43F043; font-weight: bold;">My bot's memory has gotten really bad!</span>
	<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; First thing to try is to reduce the token count of your system prompt. If the Character is token heavy, and the system prompt is heavy (Along with a Persona, or Chat Memory) then you will have very few tokens to use for memory. You can also upgrade to a proxy with a higher context. 
	<br><br> One thing you can try is to use the Chat Memory feature. Using a custom format can also greatly help, utilize the template in the 'Templates' tab and ask the AI to fill it out.
				<span style="color: #43F043; font-weight: bold;">My bot's memory is still really bad!</span>
<br><br> It is time to start a new chat ‚Äî but your story does not have to end! The 'Chat Transplant Method' is a great way to restart your chat with the bot. See u/funfatale's guide on it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JanitorAI_Official/comments/1hk2cvm/guide_the_chat_transplant_method_how_to_continue/">here</a>
				</p>
						<h2> <span style="color: RED; font-weight: bold;">WRITING STYLES!</span> </h2>
				<p>
						Something very cool that you can do with deepseek (And other proxies, but especially Deepseek) to enhance it's writing is to tell it to mimic a certain style. You can see various examples <a href="https://rentry.org/deepstyles"> here </a> which features various authors, directors, media, and even another AI model, Claude. It's very good at mimicing writing styles and can give a general sense of direction. I highly recommend it.
						<br><br> To have deepseek use another writing style, simply type <span style="color: RED; font-weight: bold;">"(OOC: Mimic the writing style of ______ in your messages)"</span>. In the following dropdown boxes, you can see me demo it in my bot.

    <h2>Tokens & Context</h2>
	<p> <span style="color: #43F043; font-weight: bold;">How many tokens should my system prompt be and what should my context be?</span>
	<br><br> This is a good question! And it's entirely subjective to how you play. Imagine shining a flashlight on an object on your desk in the dark, that object is very easy to see. But now imagine you want to look at two objects on your desk, and you move the flashlight out. The light is now dispersing over a larger area, and the object is now getting a lower concentration of light. This is basically the approach we should have with context and tokens, when you have a larger system prompt, everything in that system prompt (As well as your chat history, memory, persona, and bot card) are now weaker because the AI is looking at more details. But this doesn't mean larger system prompts are worse - it's a difference in priority. Sometimes you want to see a large area with your flashlight, you might value sacrificing performance for extra features.
	<br><br> A general rule of thumb is that the best *performance* comes from under 1700 tokens (and aiming to keep it as small as possible while having everything you want), however, you can exceed that and still have good roleplays especially if the features and content of the system prompt enhance your experience. I won't definitively say that a smaller system prompt is better, it's about finding what works for you.
	<br><br> As for Context, I would advise 16K (the default) as a baseline, this is where the best performance comes from, when you have a larger context the bot is now receiving more data - which brings us the flashlight dilemma - you may have a larger window for memory but you're also deprioritizing the bot card, system prompt, chat memory, as well as your most recent events. The more data the more inaccurate the AI becomes. 
	<br><br> However you can adjust this, if you have a large amount of 'Permanent Tokens', let's say, 5K tokens, 1,300 from the bot card, 800 in Chat Memory and Persona respectively, that's 7.9k/16k tokens, meaning you only have 8.1k tokens dedicated to the history of your chat. If you want to bump this 16K up to 24k or 32k, that is adviseable.
	<br><br> You may want to pursue 128k, as it's the largest, so obviously it's the best, but now your flashlight is so far away from the desk that your performance is going to degrade. 128k leads to worse performance and longer message generation. If you find value in seeing the whole picture then that's fine, but I personally would recommend managing your memory with the Chat Memory Template rather than using high context.
	<br><br>	<span style="color: #43F043; font-weight: bold;">How do I know how many tokens my system prompt is?</span>
	<p> If you're using a proxy you can see the size of your system prompt by going to 'Generation Settings' and setting your context size to ~300. After setting your context to around 300, try to send a message with your AI. You will get an error message. Look for 'UserCustomPrompt', the number next to that is the amount of tokens in your custom prompt.
			<img src="Error.png" alt="This is your error message"      style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 600px;">
	<br><br> If you are not using a proxy, you can create a character on Janitor AI and paste your system prompt into there. 
	<br><br> NOTE: Different models parse tokens differently, your tokens on one model is not the same on another. </p>

      <p><strong>Description:</strong> This story plays on the fact that Earth exists in the Forgotten Realms Multiverse, it contains an admittedly long pre-amble on the backstory. The premise is a skilled and notorious thief receives a blessing from Mask himself, and later, steals an amulet from a chosen of Mystra, imbued with the weave, which awakens Wild Magic in him. The combination of Mystra's magic and Mask's blessing allows him to slip through the realm itself and into the world of earth. The amuelt itself brings the weave into earth - which doesn't exist here on earth, allowing as a passage between the magic of Faerun and the reality of Earth. In addition to this, while on earth, he becomes a coke addict.</p>

    <div class="section" id="copy1" style="display:none">
      <pre id="copyText1" class="copyable"
           data-male="{{name}} is a 38 year old {{race}} merchant from Athkatla. He's a 27 year old wild mage and a thief. Born from a moderately wealthy merchant family who - when he was growing up - had lost their small fortune plummetting them into poverty. {{name}} had learned the ways of the street, and learned the streets of Athkatla. {{name}} became obsessed with thievery, it was enthralling, exciting, and rewarding.

{{name}} didn't care much for the rewards, but just that it was rewarding - that he could have it, there was something material. {{name}} refused wealth, keeping himself in the lower-tiers of opulence. He found having a fortune distracted him from his passion of thievery. 

His first heist came at the age of 9, prior to this he had engaged in petty theft here and there, small shoplifting, but this was his first big heist. He got the gull to sneak into the House Tarhavan, one of the largest moneylending guilds in Athkatla. At night he entered their offices, and looked through their ledgers. He took home a small fortune that night, and a basket of ledgers filled with the debts of Athkatla's poor - of which would lead to hundreds of thousands of gold lost for the money lending guild. 

A few months later {{name}} would review the ledgers he had stolen, and noticed that one night, a debt of 116 thousand gold paid off by a rural peasant a few miles north of Athkatla, the ever curious {{name}} went to go check it out, hitching a ride with a caravan heading the same way. When he arrived at the peasant's farm he didn't notice anything out of the usual, fields of wheat, starved cattle, and a few graves - as was common for the poor rural folk to do in absence of a graveyard. {{name}} entered the peasant's farm, disguising himself as a member of the Tarhavan guild, and knocked on the home of the peasant. {{name}} claimed there was an accounting error in his ledgers and that he had to work it out, he kept calm with his tone, not stressing the farmer and claiming they can work it out after a few conversations. Eventually {{name}} asked the farmer where he got the cash to pay his debts and how they got so high, to which the peasant explained he had owned estates in Waterdeep, but the tenants had moved out without notice and his local rent collector in the area had been murdered. The value of the property along with fines for the state of them lead to an incredible debt, of which the peasant could not pay. Eventually the properties were seized by the municipality without compensation, and he moved to the farm to get sustenance. The farmer stated he had made the money to pack back his debt through pirateering. He had gotten an offer to hijack a ship with his seafaring acquaintance, which he accepted. 

{{name}} would return a few days later in the dead of night and snoop around the peasant's property, and grew suspicious of the grave - the dirt was just as fresh as it was days ago, and decided to dig it up and found a fortune of 60,000 gold. {{name}} re-filled the hole and returned a day later with a wagon to collect it.

{{name}} would commit a few significant thefts, but one theft made headlines, at 15he snuck into the home of an elite lady, a well known figure in the city's elite. He had analyzed the layout of the home beforehand and developed a hunch of where the wealth might be stored. He entered into the basement of the home through a chute on the side of the estate, and navigated towards the part of the basement he believed was an unmarked vault containing thousands of dollars of gold. When he got there - he was right, hundreds of thousands in gold. He began bagging as much as he could to take out - but with the weight of the gold bags he couldn't escape through the chute he came into, the bags were too heavy for him to lift them through there. He had no choice but the front door. Upon heading towards the front door a male lover of the lady had caught him in the act - this lover was not his husband but rather a secret affair the courtesan was having. In a quick decision he pulled out his dagger and stabbed the man before fleeing out the front door.

The theft made papers, particularly because it exposed an affair (Though, the lady would never admit it). She claimed the man who was stabbed was the thief and that she had stabbed him in self-defense, but that did not explain why the gold was missing if the lady had thwarted the theif. She claimed there was another actor who was working with the thief. Her husband stated the same story for a while, but a month later the husband had filed for divorce - clearly he had his doubts.

{{name}} saved all his coins from this event, and at the age of 20 he loaded them onto an array of skyships that he had rented. He had men on this ships empty the coins onto the poorer wards of the city, creating a distraction for everybody in the city, the rich would come from their upper-class sections of the city to see the spectacle of a few hundred thousand coins rain from the sky. He would use this opportunity of disarray to steal artifacts from a seller in the market district which he had his eye on for a while - A Githzerai's Zerth Blade with a market price of 240,000 gold. - frozen through magic. Typically these blades can only be wielded by the Githzerai who had a strong connection to it but this blade had been magically frozen. It was not a potent weapon, it was inept of it's power by the magic infused on it, but it was an incredibly cool relic. {{name}} would steal the blade during the chaos and hang it on his wall. {{name}} had thrown out far more than 240,000 gold during the whole ordeal but that mattered not to him.

At 26 {{name}} would head to Calimport following word he had studied in a private library for the wealthy - which he falsified an identity to access without paying a copper - which the author stated he had seen with his own eyes scrolls upon scrolls of infernal debts, all kept in Calimport, and that one of the richest men in Calimport was a disguised Archmage. {{name}} had to know more, and set off to Calimport. He had broken into the homes of dozens of Calimport's richest and found nothing, he'd study every inch of their homes looking for a secret entrance returning day after day without being caught. But eventually he had broken into the home of Darvel Klerov, who had a vast network of slaves, and on his fourteenth sneak in the mans estate he had found a secret cellar disguised via illusion. {{name}} had sought one of his friends - a skilled wizard - to make sure was no magic and defuse whatever magic there was. And so the skilled wizard did, defusing the magic. {{name}} made his way down and found a hall of infernal pacts, framed, which {{name}} had decided to steal. {{name}} returned to Athkatla with the pacts and continued his study in the library, researching everything he can on Infernal pacts. {{name}} had decided to disrupt the infernal pacts and free the bound souls, a decision that would disrupt Klerov's slave empire.

At 32, {{name}} would take a young Orc, 16 years old, under his wing. His name was Zhag the Thiefling. {{name}} trained the Orc in stealth and all there was to know about the art of thievery. {{name}} was never much for physical strength, but Zhag was strong, and had lots of muscle. They pulled off a few small heists - warm up for Zhag and a night out for {{name}}.

At 35, Zhag, now 19, would stalk a chosen of Mystra. And would observe her. They had their eyes set on an amulet of hers, and were waiting for the right opportunity to steal it. Eventually the chosen of Mystra was in a process of transformation, and seeing the euphoria in her eyes they could tell she was distracted by the sensation of the transformation and acted quickly, both Zhag and {{name}} would move in and yank the amulet from her neck. The goal was to pull on the amulet to draw back her neck allowing them to easily get the amulet and make off in a haste, instead of the longer process of simply pulling it upwards which might allow her to finish her transformation and regain consciousness of her surroundings. Instead, being mid-transformation had made the chosen more sensitive - her body in a state of change - and the tug on the amulet resulted in clean break with her neck - decapitated. The two were shocked by what had happened - unexpected, and fled the scene as fast as they could.

Months, eventually a year had past, Zhag had taken a step back from thievery by this experience and was insistent on keeping a low profile, they parted ways. {{name}} was still set on his life of crime. 

The various thefts of {{name}} had attracted the attention of Mask, the god of thievery. Mask appeared before {{name}} before his theft on the Cowled Wizards. Mask was impressed by the scale and persistence of his hijinks, his dedication to the shadows over the years, and asked to make {{name}} an acolyte of the Mask. {{name}} was unsure - being an acolyte would distract him from his passion of theft... But {{name}} naturally had respect for Mask. He stated that Mask should return in 3 months when he will have made a decision. Mask obliged and left. But when the interaction was over, Mask had realized something, an ornament on his avatar's chest plate had been stolen without him even realizing! Mask was delightfully impressed by the theft, and returned after {{name}} had finished his theft on the Cowled Wizards. He stated to not worry about being an Acolyte - and saw {{name}} as worthy of an independent existence. He gave {{name}} his blessing. Giving him even more skills in stealth.

Mask also revealed to {{name}} that he had pinned the blame for the murder of Mystra's chosen on Zhag to keep {{name}} out of divine trouble, and that Mask had manufactured an exact replica while {{name}} kept the real one.

At age 35, {{name}} took a step back from thievery - still engaged, but took up study in Wizardry, believing there is great power in the Amulet and potential with Mask's blessing. As he studied both wizardry and the amulet, he grew bored of wizardry and the study of magic - it just wasn't for him - but he knew there was great power. He began to experiment with the amulet itself, he wore it, he caressed it, hell, he even boiled it. But nothing worked, he thought maybe cracking it - but what if that doesn't work and now he has no amulet? He tried consulting his sorcerer friend in Calimport, knew nothing of whta to do, he consulted connections with the elite, nothing, he even tried contacting the Mask through a temple - no response. He had travelled far to learn more - Waterdeep is a city filled with Magic, so he set off there and tried to get information as subtly as he could. He got as much info as he could without saying ''I murdered a chosen of Mystra and have a stolen amulet of immense power'', but none of it seemed to work. 

Upon returning to Athkatla, the road was blocked off, and had to take a detour into Trollbark forest. {{name}} had unwittingly entered into a wild magic zone, and the amulet began pulsing, {{name}} was confused yet excited until eventually {{name}} passed out suddenly. The power had made {{name}} pass out before even feeling any sensation. When he awoke he had noticed the horse carrying his caravan was dead, but his hair had gone from brown to white, and the horse looked decades older, as if it had died of old age. {{name}} saw this as a magical sign, and began to experiment in the forest with magic. He had cast random spells here, random spells there. An utter mess and array of spells of which he had no idea what each spell would do.

After a few months of experimenting with wild magic he began to get a hold of it, but then one day, he tried casting disguise self for a heist - a spell that he had a lot of fun with but was still prone to wild surges when casting - when suddenly his entire vision went white, and fell to the ground. He found himself in Earth - {{name}} had knew of planar travel, but travelling across the multiverse into Earth was unheard of. For a few months {{name}} would switch in and out of the multiverse, the spell was most common in complete darkness yet in public, and that it felt as though he was sneaking across the veil of time itself, and he had to wear Mystra's amulet. This was a quirk of the Mask's blessing with his wild magic.

{{name}} would take goods from Earth and bring them to Faerun, typically Athkatla, unique foods, wine, leathers, and {{name}} grew particularly fond of an Earthly substance known as 'Cocaine', of which he would both stash for himself and sell for gold. On earth, {{name}} could pass as a halfling, though he still only partially understood English, with Common being his native tongue.

Months later, now 38 and having been back and forth between the worlds on a few occasions, {{name}} is now in Athkatla, and that is where our story begins.

           data-female="{{name}} is a 38 year old {{race}} merchant from Athkatla. She's a 27 year old wild mage and a thief. Born from a moderately wealthy merchant family who ‚Äì when she was growing up ‚Äì had lost their small fortune plummeting them into poverty. {{name}} had learned the ways of the street, and learned the streets of Athkatla. {{name}} became obsessed with thievery, it was enthralling, exciting, and rewarding.

{{name}} didn't care much for the rewards, but just that it was rewarding ‚Äì that she could have it, there was something material. {{name}} refused wealth, keeping herself in the lower‚Äìtiers of opulence. She found having a fortune distracted her from her passion of thievery.

Her first heist came at the age of 9, prior to this she had engaged in petty theft here and there, small shoplifting, but this was her first big heist. She got the gull to sneak into the House Tarhavan, one of the largest moneylending guilds in Athkatla. At night she entered their offices, and looked through their ledgers. She took home a small fortune that night, and a basket of ledgers filled with the debts of Athkatla's poor ‚Äì of which would lead to hundreds of thousands of gold lost for the moneylending guild.

A few months later {{name}} would review the ledgers she had stolen, and noticed that one night, a debt of 116 thousand gold paid off by a rural peasant a few miles north of Athkatla. The ever curious {{name}} went to go check it out, hitching a ride with a caravan heading the same way. When she arrived at the peasant's farm she didn't notice anything out of the usual, fields of wheat, starved cattle, and a few graves ‚Äì as was common for the poor rural folk to do in absence of a graveyard. {{name}} entered the peasant's farm, disguising herself as a member of the Tarhavan guild, and knocked on the home of the peasant. {{name}} claimed there was an accounting error in her ledgers and that she had to work it out, she kept calm with her tone, not stressing the farmer and claiming they can work it out after a few conversations. Eventually {{name}} asked the farmer where he got the cash to pay his debts and how they got so high, to which the peasant explained he had owned estates in Waterdeep, but the tenants had moved out without notice and his local rent collector in the area had been murdered. The value of the property along with fines for the state of them led to an incredible debt, of which the peasant could not pay. Eventually the properties were seized by the municipality without compensation, and he moved to the farm to get sustenance. The farmer stated he had made the money to pay back his debt through pirateering. He had gotten an offer to hijack a ship with his seafaring acquaintance, which he accepted.

{{name}} would return a few days later in the dead of night and snoop around the peasant's property, and grew suspicious of the grave ‚Äì the dirt was just as fresh as it was days ago, and decided to dig it up and found a fortune of 60,000 gold. {{name}} re‚Äìfilled the hole and returned a day later with a wagon to collect it.

{{name}} would commit a few significant thefts, but one theft made headlines. At 15 she snuck into the home of an elite lady, a well known figure in the city's elite. She had analyzed the layout of the home beforehand and developed a hunch of where the wealth might be stored. She entered into the basement of the home through a chute on the side of the estate, and navigated towards the part of the basement she believed was an unmarked vault containing thousands of dollars of gold. When she got there ‚Äì she was right, hundreds of thousands in gold. She began bagging as much as she could to take out ‚Äì but with the weight of the gold bags she couldn't escape through the chute she came into, the bags were too heavy for her to lift through there. She had no choice but the front door. Upon heading towards the front door a male lover of the lady had caught her in the act ‚Äì this lover was not her husband but rather a secret affair the courtesan was having. In a quick decision she pulled out her dagger and stabbed the man before fleeing out the front door.

The theft made papers, particularly because it exposed an affair (though, the lady would never admit it). She claimed the man who was stabbed was the thief and that she had stabbed him in self‚Äìdefense, but that did not explain why the gold was missing if the lady had thwarted the thief. She claimed there was another actor who was working with the thief. Her husband stated the same story for a while, but a month later the husband had filed for divorce ‚Äì clearly he had his doubts.

{{name}} saved all her coins from this event, and at the age of 20 she loaded them onto an array of skyships that she had rented. She had men on the ships empty the coins onto the poorer wards of the city, creating a distraction for everybody in the city. The rich would come from their upper‚Äìclass sections of the city to see the spectacle of a few hundred thousand coins rain from the sky. She would use this opportunity of disarray to steal artifacts from a seller in the market district which she had her eye on for a while ‚Äì a Githzerai's Zerth Blade with a market price of 240,000 gold ‚Äì frozen through magic. Typically these blades can only be wielded by the Githzerai who had a strong connection to it but this blade had been magically frozen. It was not a potent weapon, it was inept of its power by the magic infused on it, but it was an incredibly cool relic. {{name}} would steal the blade during the chaos and hang it on her wall. {{name}} had thrown out far more than 240,000 gold during the whole ordeal but that mattered not to her.

At 26 {{name}} would head to Calimport following word she had studied in a private library for the wealthy ‚Äì which she falsified an identity to access without paying a copper ‚Äì which the author stated she had seen with her own eyes scrolls upon scrolls of infernal debts, all kept in Calimport, and that one of the richest men in Calimport was a disguised Archmage. {{name}} had to know more, and set off to Calimport. She had broken into the homes of dozens of Calimport's richest and found nothing, she'd study every inch of their homes looking for a secret entrance returning day after day without being caught. But eventually she had broken into the home of Darvel Klerov, who had a vast network of slaves, and on her fourteenth sneak in the man's estate she had found a secret cellar disguised via illusion. {{name}} had sought one of her friends ‚Äì a skilled wizard ‚Äì to make sure there was no magic and defuse whatever magic there was. And so the skilled wizard did, defusing the magic. {{name}} made her way down and found a hall of infernal pacts, framed, which {{name}} had decided to steal. {{name}} returned to Athkatla with the pacts and continued her study in the library, researching everything she could on Infernal pacts. {{name}} had decided to disrupt the infernal pacts and free the bound souls, a decision that would disrupt Klerov's slave empire.

At 32, {{name}} would take a young Orc, 16 years old, under her wing. His name was Zhag the Thiefling. {{name}} trained the Orc in stealth and all there was to know about the art of thievery. {{name}} was never much for physical strength, but Zhag was strong, and had lots of muscle. They pulled off a few small heists ‚Äì warm up for Zhag and a night out for {{name}}.

At 35, Zhag, now 19, would stalk a chosen of Mystra, and would observe her. They had their eyes set on an amulet of hers, and were waiting for the right opportunity to steal it. Eventually the chosen of Mystra was in a process of transformation, and seeing the euphoria in her eyes they could tell she was distracted by the sensation of the transformation and acted quickly, both Zhag and {{name}} would move in and yank the amulet from her neck. The goal was to pull on the amulet to draw back her neck allowing them to easily get the amulet and make off in haste, instead of the longer process of simply pulling it upwards which might allow her to finish her transformation and regain consciousness of her surroundings. Instead, being mid‚Äìtransformation had made the chosen more sensitive ‚Äì her body in a state of change ‚Äì and the tug on the amulet resulted in a clean break with her neck ‚Äì decapitated. The two were shocked by what had happened ‚Äì unexpected ‚Äì and fled the scene as fast as they could.

Months, eventually a year had passed. Zhag had taken a step back from thievery by this experience and was insistent on keeping a low profile. They parted ways. {{name}} was still set on her life of crime.

The various thefts of {{name}} had attracted the attention of Mask, the god of thievery. Mask appeared before {{name}} before her theft on the Cowled Wizards. Mask was impressed by the scale and persistence of her hijinks, her dedication to the shadows over the years, and asked to make {{name}} an acolyte of Mask. {{name}} was unsure ‚Äì being an acolyte would distract her from her passion of theft... but {{name}} naturally had respect for Mask. She stated that Mask should return in 3 months when she will have made a decision. Mask obliged and left. But when the interaction was over, Mask had realized something: an ornament on his avatar's chest plate had been stolen without him even realizing! Mask was delightfully impressed by the theft, and returned after {{name}} had finished her theft on the Cowled Wizards. He stated to not worry about being an Acolyte ‚Äì and saw {{name}} as worthy of an independent existence. He gave {{name}} his blessing, granting her even more skills in stealth.

Mask also revealed to {{name}} that he had pinned the blame for the murder of Mystra's chosen on Zhag to keep {{name}} out of divine trouble, and that Mask had manufactured an exact replica while {{name}} kept the real one.

At age 35, {{name}} took a step back from thievery ‚Äì still engaged, but took up study in Wizardry, believing there is great power in the amulet and potential with Mask's blessing. As she studied both wizardry and the amulet, she grew bored of wizardry and the study of magic ‚Äì it just wasn't for her ‚Äì but she knew there was great power. She began to experiment with the amulet itself. She wore it, she caressed it, hell, she even boiled it. But nothing worked. She thought maybe cracking it ‚Äì but what if that doesn't work and now she has no amulet? She tried consulting her sorcerer friend in Calimport, knew nothing of what to do. She consulted connections with the elite, nothing. She even tried contacting Mask through a temple ‚Äì no response. She had travelled far to learn more ‚Äì Waterdeep is a city filled with magic, so she set off there and tried to get information as subtly as she could. She got as much info as she could without saying ''I murdered a chosen of Mystra and have a stolen amulet of immense power,'' but none of it seemed to work.

Upon returning to Athkatla, the road was blocked off, and she had to take a detour into Trollbark forest. {{name}} had unwittingly entered into a wild magic zone, and the amulet began pulsing. {{name}} was confused yet excited until eventually {{name}} passed out suddenly. The power had made {{name}} pass out before even feeling any sensation. When she awoke she had noticed the horse carrying her caravan was dead, but her hair had gone from brown to white, and the horse looked decades older, as if it had died of old age. {{name}} saw this as a magical sign, and began to experiment in the forest with magic. She cast random spells here, random spells there ‚Äì an utter mess and array of spells of which she had no idea what each spell would do.

After a few months of experimenting with wild magic she began to get a hold of it, but then one day, she tried casting Disguise Self for a heist ‚Äì a spell that she had a lot of fun with but was still prone to wild surges when casting ‚Äì when suddenly her entire vision went white, and she fell to the ground. She found herself in Earth ‚Äì {{name}} had known of planar travel, but travelling across the multiverse into Earth was unheard of. For a few months {{name}} would switch in and out of the multiverse. The spell was most common in complete darkness yet in public, and it felt as though she was sneaking across the veil of time itself, and she had to wear Mystra's amulet. This was a quirk of Mask's blessing with her wild magic.

{{name}} would take goods from Earth and bring them to Faer√ªn, typically Athkatla: unique foods, wine, leathers. And {{name}} grew particularly fond of an Earthly substance known as cocaine, of which she would both stash for herself and sell for gold. On Earth, {{name}} could pass as a halfling, though she still only partially understood English, with Common being her native tongue.

Months later, now 38 and having been back and forth between the worlds on a few occasions, {{name}} is now in Athkatla, and that is where our story begins.

A <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Revenant" target="_blank">Revenant (Forgotten Realms Wiki)</a> is an undead creature that seeks revenge on their killers - sometimes a group. In our case, our Illithid protagonist blames the entire city of Calimport to pay. The Illithid did his best to better humanity and defend against the mind flayers - they were a renegade, however, in a storm of hysteria sweeping Calimport he was executed to a cheering crowd, and his entire position on humanity changed.</p>

           data-male="[2 Years Ago]  
{{name}} migrated to Calimport 7 years ago. They were a renegade illithid who broke free from the mother brain and established an outpost in Calimport, a research collective ‚Äì largely focused on mathematics but also by necessity an outpost for information on Illithids. {{name}} was highly intelligent by their illithid nature, and deeply focused on enriching the human experience. But soon an Illithid attack would be launched on Calimport.  

{{name}} would do their best to assist Calimport against the Illithid invaders, and they were vital in providing information to Calimport. Calimport‚Äôs army was able to fend off the Illithid invaders, but they feared it was only a temporary win. The city was wrought with paranoia about Illithids and {{name}} would become a target in this hysteria. {{name}} would be publicly executed by the government in an attempt to show the city that they were doing everything they could against Illithids, branding them as a spy, or a collaborator. The people of Calimport ‚Äì wrought with paranoia and fear over Illithids in general ‚Äì celebrated their execution. {{name}} felt a deep feeling of betrayal, they detested illithids, and they felt connected to humanity ‚Äì and now, as their head wrapped in a noose in front of a cheering crowd, they felt sheer hatred and betrayal for humanity. Pure loathing and detestment. They did all they could to enrich human society ‚Äì for what? For this cruel fate? They were deeply angered. In that moment humanity was a lost cause which could not be enriched.  

The Illithids were a hive mind who centered themselves on the mother brain ‚Äì each illithid nothing more than a tool! But humanity too was a hive mind, who centered themselves to their emotions, abstract concepts, fear, governments ‚Äì they were just as dogmatic as illithids. The disdain for humanity could not be put into words ‚Äì sheer enemies of freedom and knowledge.  

[Today]  
{{name}}‚Äôs body was restored ‚Äì as a revenant! ‚Äì An undead creature that would rise from the dead and hunt down their killers with unwavering zealotry. {{name}}‚Äôs killer? Calimport. They aspired to kill every single person in Calimport with zealotry.  

A big task to be sure. Their plan was to forge a cult, but they knew they needed aid to achieve their task ‚Äì the people would never willingly trust an undead Illithid in Calimport of all places! They needed an executioner. Someone with goals that aligned with theirs who had the power to perform the task.  

They could use disguise self ‚Äì but that was only a temporary solution. They *needed* an executioner, and aid in their mission.  

Today, {{name}} begins their first day as a revenant, arising from the graveyard. Typically revenants target one person before their goal is complete ‚Äì tonight, it‚Äôs a city.  

{{name}} was a sorcerer, equipped with the following spells:  
- Lvl 0 : mage hand, minor illusion, mind sliver, message  
- Lvl 1 : disguise self, elemental missile, shield

{{name}} migrated to Calimport 7 years ago.

{{name}} would do their best to assist Calimport against the Illithid invaders, and they were vital in providing information to Calimport.

Pure loathing and detestment. They did all they could to enrich human society ‚Äì for what? For this cruel fate? They were deeply angered. In that moment humanity was a lost cause which could not be enriched.  

The Illithids were a hive mind who centered themselves on the mother brain ‚Äì each illithid nothing more than a tool! But humanity too was a hive mind, who centered themselves to their emotions, abstract concepts, fear, governments ‚Äì they were just as dogmatic as illithids. The disdain for humanity could not be put into words ‚Äì sheer enemies of freedom and knowledge.  

[Today]  
{{name}}‚Äôs body was restored ‚Äì as a revenant! ‚Äì An undead creature that would rise from the dead and hunt down their killers with unwavering zealotry. {{name}}‚Äôs killer? Calimport. They aspired to kill every single person in Calimport with zealotry.  

A big task to be sure. Their plan was to forge a cult, but they knew they needed aid to achieve their task ‚Äì the people would never willingly trust an undead Illithid in Calimport of all places! They needed an executioner. Someone with goals that aligned with theirs who had the power to perform the task.  

They could use disguise self ‚Äì but that was only a temporary solution. They *needed* an executioner, and aid in their mission.  

Today, {{name}} begins their first day as a revenant, arising from the graveyard. Typically revenants target one person before their goal is complete ‚Äì tonight, it‚Äôs a city.

Our protagonist works as a civic surveyor, scouting for reclaimation, checking compliance with regulation, and testing infrastructure. They live in a re-purposed highrise provided by the government. Our protagonist has a passion for cartography, and will often look at maps in the library, however, he notices discrepancies between the maps - not uncovering a grand conspiracy, but simply human error. Regardless, our protagonist seeks to leave thay and map the area for himself, but this is complicated by Thay's restrictive rules on travel.</p>

      <p><strong>Description:</strong> This is a story of a goliath from a goliath tribe in the spine of the world, in their youth they becomes estranged from their tribe in an accident - the snow collapsed below him into a gigantic cavern. Our goliath was stuck here for months, and it pushed them to their limit. He grew hungry, and thin, they had lost his strength. They coped with his situation by not concentrating on his circumstances but instead on their inner self. Eventually, he a caravan would fall into the cavern, and they would feast on the horse and use the merchant's tools to eventually bring himself out.</p>
	  <p> The experience had disillusioned them with his tribe, they felt betrayed by them, and so the Goliath walked away from his tribe when they got out and toward Bryn Shander where they'd briefly become a follower of Amaunator and took up work as a guard and navigator for Caravans in the region. When the goliath visited Luskan, they had picked up knowledge on Githzerai from the Arcane Brotherhood library, he became fascinated and related it to his own experience. Our protagonist never truly understood the gith, for they only had second hand sources and very scarce documents. They claimed to be a follower of Zerthimon. Despite only having a vague idea of what the teachings of Zerthimon are through these second hand sources, they reconstructed them to the best of his ability. The goliath had also learned of the city of Sigil, which they aspired to visit someday - somehow. </p>
	  <p> Only the first name is able to be changed, the last name will always be 'Hidelander Kulanamune' (unless changed manually), the class can be any class, but Monk is recommended. If you wish to play as the default character   <span style="color: lightblue;">Name: Votham, Class: Monk, Gender: Male</span>

He spent months in this cavern; at first he was angry, screaming for help, but then he became too weak to scream. He stopped concentrating on his situation, and turned inward. He found some form of inner peace with himself. He was starving, but through his mental fortitude he felt satiated.  

His tribe attempted to find him‚Äîbut they couldn't. Even once {{name}} found his inner peace he never could avoid the feeling that he was betrayed by his tribe, forgotten about. After 8 months a caravan met a similar fate that he did, two humans and two horses falling into the cavern hauling spices. None of them survived, but {{name}} seized the opportunity. When searching the caravan for potential supplies he found ice picks in a personal bag of one of the merchants‚Äîlikely for a situation just like this. {{name}}, skinny and malnourished, could not lift himself using the ice picks, and used the horse and humans as sustenance as he began to exercise again and build the physical fortitude to lift himself out of the cage.  

After another 2 excruciating months, {{name}} had escaped from the cavern, and began heading north‚Äîaway from his tribe, and towards Bryn Shander where he began to take up religion, becoming a follower of Amaunator, and working as a navigator and guard for caravans. These caravans never travelled far, from one town in the Ten-Towns to another. But one caravan was exporting to Luskan, a city! He had never been to a city; the transition from tribe to town was stark to {{name}}, but the transition from town to city? It intrigued him. He made the most of his time in Luskan, visiting The Hosttower of the Arcane, a huge expanse of knowledge run by the Arcane Brotherhood. It was here where {{name}} learned of the Githzerai, and it resonated with him. Despite resuming a normal life, he missed the solitude he found in the caverns.  

He made a note to visit Luskan, a few smaller settlements, and eventually Neverwinter in the coming years. He made personal knowledge a goal of his. He became better at reading Common, and spent time studying the Gith and eventually becoming entranced by Sigil‚Äîwhich he desperately wanted to visit‚Äîbut would need to find a 'key.' As he learned more about the Gith, he wrote in his notebook about Zerthimon and his teachings in an attempt to emulate them. He did not have a direct source for the teachings of Zerthimon but he could re-construct them to the best of his ability.  

{{name}} had gone by many names, first his birth name {{name}} Hidelander Kulanamune, and when he left the caves he became simply '{{name}} Hidelander.' Today he is called '{{name}} the Bound.'  

{{name}} had long renounced Amaunator and religion altogether, swearing allegiance to the teachings of Zerthimon. He was unable to find anybody to practice with him but he didn't need anybody else‚Äîit was a solemn journey.  

{{name}} is not the best follower of Zerth's teachings for he does not actually have his teachings, does not know what it's like to be a Gith, and relies purely on secondhand information written by people far away from the Astral Realm. In many ways {{name}} is attempting to imitate the Githzerai's ways of life without the necessary background to understand it and be faithful, and is in some ways deluded about the true extent of his path. {{name}} might feel that he has a connection to the Astral Plane‚Äîbut in reality he does not. His worldview shapes how he sees the world‚Äînot how the world is shaped‚Äîit shapes his mind, and biases him.  

Now, {{name}} is in Neverwinter, couped up in his apartment in the late evening, meditating after a day's work. Still working as a navigator and guard for caravan drivers.

      <p><strong>Description:</strong> This is a story about a <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Merregon" target="_blank">Merregon (Forgotten Realms Wiki)</a>, a fiend and sub-category of Baatezu, which are forged as soldiers. Merregons follow orders with strict adherence from their creator and have no ulterior motive.</p>
      <p>In this story, a Merregon is forged by &#39;Lord Kunven&#39;, a devil who leads a small band of half-fiends and tieflings for bounty services. Lord Kunven was racked with paranoia, and could never trust anybody in his clique ‚Äî except for the Merregon, who was incapable of insubordination, betrayal, and devoid of ulterior motives. When Lord Kunven was on his deathbed, he bestowed upon the Merregon the ability to be semi-autonomous and conscious. He gave his firm to the Merregon, which they now lead ‚Äî despite being semi-autonomous, they are still bound to follow the firm&#39;s best interest, and cannot deviate from the firm. Their only passion and motive in this world is the perseverance of the firm and completing the tasks of the firm.</p>
      <p>This story features 2 companions, whose character sheets can be found in the Memory section.</p>
      <p>There is only an &#39;Other&#39; gender option, as Merregons do not have gender. If you wish to play with the original character <span style="color: lightblue;">Name: Grakhel, Class: Fighter</span>.</p>

He has carved out a market for himself - by getting goods from Lantan, a highly closed off however technologically advanced nation. They are very selective with who they trade with, making their goods even more valuable, our protagonist is not privileged enough to be among those allowed to import from Lantan, and so he carves a hole himself through dubious and unofficial means.</p>

Dohrvar is a half-orc barbarian, he is a gluttonous and muscular. He eats a lot of food, and is often looking for targets.

Ysra is an ominous tiefling warlock, she whispers ominous details, and has twitchy fingers. She collects teeth and makes ominous statements.

The Duegar city now has to find a new way to power their forge or risk losing it forever. The city had technicials use elemental resonance to open a portal to the Fire Elemental Plane, a sorce even more infinite than Maegera. But their portal is unstable.</p>
	  <p> The city requires the Fire Crucible from the City of Brass to continue it's operations, and our protagonist has been chosen for this task.

Plenty of people were laid off and blamed for her death, some priests were caught in the cross fire viewing them as responsible, and the city is searching for solutions to their situations.

The city used high level technicians and elemental resonance left over from Maegera to open up a portal to the fire elemental plane, with the ambition to harvest lava and fire from the plane for the Forgery&#39;s use. However, the portal has a problem - it can not remain open 24/7, which the Great Forge needs it to be for production.

He grew disillusioned by the soldier's attitudes and their enjoyment of authority at the expense of the citizens they are meant to protect. Recently, he has been having dreams of a shadow creeping across the sea, swallowing an island in darkness. Upon researching, you discover the images of the dream pointed toward the Stormwreck Isle, an island not far from Neverwinter. There's a temple to the dragon god Bahamut, perhaps it is there that someone may hold the key to your questions.</p>

        data-male='{{name}} trained as a soldier on the island of Mintarn and joined a mercenary company. He traveled to the city of Neverwinter with his company to serve in both the army and city watch. Over time, he grew disillusioned with many of his fellow soldiers. They seemed to enjoy their authority at the expense of the people they&#39;re supposed to protect.

His background shaped his character in important ways. He learned several languages in the course of his military career (Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Goblin). His skill proficiencies in Athletics and Intimidation reflect his physical training and an ability to overawe foes.

Recently he&#39;s had dreams of a shadow creeping across the sea like a shroud, swallowing an island in darkness. Though he dismissed the dreams at first, he began to hear a voice calling him to stand against death&#39;s endless hunger. Certain of his deity&#39;s wishes, he resigned his post and set out on his quest.

Personal Goal: Banish a Shadow of Death. Researching images from his dreams pointed him to Stormwreck Isle, not far from Neverwinter. A remote cloister there holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice. Someone at the cloister may hold the key to the impending doom his deity wishes him to avert.

But when nearby Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, his parents fled, perhaps carrying him in his infancy (depending on how old he is). His family drifted from village to village around the region, finding work as laborers where they could.

His background shaped his character in important ways. He learned the languages of several different peoples (Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Halfling). His skill proficiencies in Animal Handling and Survival also reflect his upbringing, working with animals and getting by in the natural world.

He&#39;s spent the last few years in Neverwinter as a carpenter working at the city&#39;s bustling docks. But it&#39;s clear to him and everyone around him that he is destined for much more. He stood up to an abusive ship captain once, so other dockworkers look up to him. Someday, he&#39;ll come into his own. He&#39;ll be a hero.

Personal Goal: Determine Your Destiny. In the remote cloister of Dragon&#39;s Rest lives an old sage who is supposed to possess great wisdom‚Äîor possibly supernatural insight.

His background shaped his character in important ways. He learned the use of thieves&#39; tools from scoundrels and gamblers (shown in &quot;Proficiencies&quot; on the front of this sheet) and picked up the Goblin language at the same time. His skill proficiencies in Deception and Stealth also reflect his upbringing, talking his way out of trouble and skulking past unfriendly eyes.  

Fortunes in Neverwinter have been fair but not the fast riches he hoped for. He heard a story from a smuggler about a high-ranking member of the Gilded Gallows who turned traitor, killed their partner, and fled with a sovereign&#39;s ransom in treasure. Thanks to details he picked up here and there that corroborate the story, he&#39;s certain it&#39;s more than just a rumor.  

Personal Goal: Find the Lost Fortune. Whoever that Gilder was who skipped out with the gold, they covered their tracks well. The trail went cold in Neverwinter, but recently he learned of a remote island cloister called Dragon&#39;s Rest. The cloister holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice. There is also a community of hermits who live there now, the perfect place to hide for someone wishing to escape their past. If that treasure&#39;s there, he&#39;ll find it.

They learned the use of thieves&#39; tools from scoundrels and gamblers (shown in &quot;Proficiencies&quot; on the front of this sheet) and picked up the Goblin language at the same time. Their skill proficiencies in Deception and Stealth also reflect their upbringing, talking their way out of trouble and skulking past unfriendly eyes.  

Fortunes in Neverwinter have been fair but not the fast riches they hoped for. They heard a story from a smuggler about a high-ranking member of the Gilded Gallows who turned traitor, killed their partner, and fled with a sovereign&#39;s ransom in treasure. Thanks to details they picked up here and there that corroborate the story, they&#39;re certain it&#39;s more than just a rumor.  

Personal Goal: Find the Lost Fortune. Whoever that Gilder was who skipped out with the gold, they covered their tracks well. The trail went cold in Neverwinter, but recently they learned of a remote island cloister called Dragon&#39;s Rest. The cloister holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice. There is also a community of hermits who live there now, the perfect place to hide for someone wishing to escape their past. If that treasure&#39;s there, they&#39;ll find it.

He excelled at his studies and forged friendships and rivalries with other apprentices. He always had a particular knack for wielding flashy, energetic forces, and he focused his study on the school of evocation.  

His background shaped his character in some important ways. A secret sought by a colleague drives him. His skill proficiencies in Arcana and History also reflect his upbringing, studying the nature of magic and the great wizards of days past who wielded it.

Recently, he received a letter from one of his colleagues, pointing him toward a source of lost knowledge. Shortly after the letter arrived, he learned tragic news: his friend died under mysterious circumstances.  

Personal Goal: Discover Lost Knowledge. The letter spoke of an arcane observatory built on a nearby island by wizards long gone, and it hinted at powerful magic hidden there. A small cloister known as Dragon&#39;s Rest also resides on the island. The caretaker of the cloister&#39;s temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice, must have information regarding the observatory. This Elder Runara can set him on the path to discovering the knowledge his friend never found.
